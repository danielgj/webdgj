# Welcome to Daniel Garcia Jones's webpage

(Testing from Ubuntu)

This project is aimed to construct my own personal web page using a modern web development environment.

This project uses Gulp as the buildtool and will allow me to explore things like Saas, Gulp, Babel, Mocha and ES6 and Babel.

The web template is custom made using Bootstrap. Feel free to use it or adapt it.

##Dependencies

* gulp (npm install -g gulp)
* gulp-cli (npm install -g gulp-cli)

##Run

After installing dependencies just run 'gulp'
